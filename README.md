Voice activated virtual assistants are the most advanced form of a type of AI customer service technology that is sometimes referred to as “chatbots.”
Chatbots tend to be a more straightforward form of customer service, such as a pop-up screen that can answer questions via typing and text only.

Voice activated virtual assistants are more advanced than simple chatbots and can handle a more complex range of questions and transactions than simple text-based inquiries. Virtual assistants can also handle more specific, personalized requests, such as sending money to friends and family, or quickly pulling up data on recent shopping trips.

Virtual assistants with voice recognition and personalized insights—not just simple typing and responses to basic inquiries—are the next evolution of AI-powered technology for digital banking and customer service.
Some banking virtual assistants not only help you make transactions, but also help you keep track of your spending and show you advanced insights about where your money goes. Bank of America’s Erica provides several key insights into your finances, including:

*Weekly snapshot of spending
*Search for past transactions
*Monitoring recurring charges
*Notifications of changes to your FICO credit score
Tracking account balance trends

Although banking virtual assistants are still relatively new and were not listed among respondents’ choices for most valuable mobile app features, four of the top five most valuable tasks can be done via a bank’s virtual assistant:

*Viewing statements and account balances (most valuable feature for 33% of respondents)
*Transferring funds between accounts (31%)
*Bill pay (28%)
*Peer-to-peer payments (11%)

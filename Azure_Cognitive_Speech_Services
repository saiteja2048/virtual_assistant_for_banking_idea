The Speech service provides speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities with an Azure Speech resource. You can transcribe speech to text with high accuracy, produce natural-sounding text-to-speech voices, translate spoken audio, and use speaker recognition during conversations.

Create custom voices, add specific words to your base vocabulary, or build your own models. Run Speech anywhere, in the cloud or at the edge in containers. It's easy to speech enable your applications, tools, and devices with the Speech CLI, Speech SDK, Speech Studio, or REST APIs.
**SPEECH CAPABILITIES
Speech feature summaries are provided below with links for more information.

**SPEECH-TO-TEXT
Use speech-to-text to transcribe audio into text, either in real time or asynchronously.

Convert audio to text from a range of sources, including microphones, audio files, and blob storage. Use speaker diarisation to determine who said what and when. Get readable transcripts with automatic formatting and punctuation.
**TEXT-TO-SPEECH
With text to speech, you can convert input text into humanlike synthesized speech. Use neural voices, which are humanlike voices powered by deep neural networks. Use the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) to fine-tune the pitch, pronunciation, speaking rate, volume, and more.
**LANGUAGE IDENTIFICATION
Language identification is used to identify languages spoken in audio when compared against a list of supported languages. Use language identification by itself, with speech-to-text recognition, or with speech translation.

**SPEAKER RECOGNITION
Speaker recognition provides algorithms that verify and identify speakers by their unique voice characteristics. Speaker recognition is used to answer the question, "Who is speaking?".

**PRONOUNCIATION ASSESSMENT
Pronunciation assessment evaluates speech pronunciation and gives speakers feedback on the accuracy and fluency of spoken audio. With pronunciation assessment, language learners can practice, get instant feedback, and improve their pronunciation so that they can speak and present with confidence.

**INTENT RECOGNITION
Intent recognition: Use speech-to-text with Language Understanding (LUIS) to derive user intents from transcribed speech and act on voice commands

Applications such as Voice assistants listen to users and take an action in response, often speaking back. They use speech-to-text to transcribe the user's speech, then take action on the natural language understanding of the text. This action frequently includes spoken output from the assistant generated with text-to-speech. Devices connect to assistants with the Speech SDK's DialogServiceConnector object.

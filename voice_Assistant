By using voice assistants with the Speech service, developers can create natural, human-like, conversational interfaces for their applications and experiences.

The voice assistant service provides fast, reliable interaction between a device and an assistant implementation that uses either Direct Line Speech (via Azure Bot Service) for adding voice capabilities to your bots or Custom Commands for voice-command scenarios.
**CHOOSING AND ASSISTANT SOLUTION
*For Open-ended conversation with robust skills integration and full deployment control
       we can consider Azure Bot Service bot with Direct Line Speech channel
       Examples:
          "I need to go to Seattle"
          "What kind of pizza can I order?"
* For Voice-command or simple task-oriented conversations with simplified authoring and hosting
       we can consider custom commands
       Examples:
           "Turn on the overhead light"
           "Make it 5 degrees warmer"

The Bot Framework, along with the Azure Bot Service, provides tools to build, test, deploy, and manage intelligent bots, all in one place. The Bot Framework includes a modular and extensible SDK for building bots, as well as tools, templates, and related AI services. With this framework, developers can create bots that use speech, understand natural language, handle questions and answers, and more.

Bots provide an experience that feels less like using a computer and more like dealing with a person - or at least an intelligent robot. They can be used to shift simple, repetitive tasks—such as taking a dinner reservation or gathering profile information—onto automated systems that may no longer require direct human intervention. Users converse with a bot using text, interactive cards, and speech. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a sophisticated conversation that intelligently provides access to services.

A bot can be thought of as a web application that has a conversational interface. A user connects to a bot through a channel such as Facebook, Slack, or Microsoft Teams.

**The bot reasons about input and performs relevant tasks. This can include asking the user for additional information or accessing services on behalf of the user.
**The bot performs recognition on the user's input to interpret what the user is asking for or saying.
**The bot generates responses to send to the user to communicate what the bot is doing or has done.
**Depending on how the bot is configured and how it's registered with the channel, users can interact with the bot through text or speech, and the conversation might include images and video.
